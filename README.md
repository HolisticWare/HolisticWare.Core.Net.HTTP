1) Add an optional dictionary for headers (this would allow to insert things like API keys)
        
2) Timeout option as you might not want to await that request forever
        
3) Multiform probably could use cancellation token
        
4) Optional method to use the multiform with a stream instead of byte buffer (might be better with large files)
